# Bhavya Deepthi

## Current
I have become a member of the Bearcat family from the fall 2019 batch by joining the Masters of Applied Computer Science program.

## Background
Well, am from Tirupati, a holy place in India which every Indian wish to visit at least once in their lifetime. As a part of my academic background, I have received an undergraduate degree in the stream of Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2017. Later on, worked for 2 years in TATA Consultancy Services(TCS) as an Assistant System Engineer. Keeping my academics and career aside, I like to spend my free time with family and friends. Recently cooking became a part of my interests too

## Plans
Since there were fluctuations in the roles in the company back then, I am assuming the knowledge I gain through masters in the field of Computing would act as a bridge to settle as a Full-stack developer in future.
